# A Python not-very-POSIXy shell

A not (yet) very posixy shell implementation in Python.

For no good reason, except that I was reading the posix shell
documentation.

That seems, on the whole, to have been written to describe
a particular implementation - especially the way that backtick
parsing works. It's all slightly reminiscent of Tcl's evaluation
model.

It's also led me to nose around looking at corner-cases of
the implementation of various shells.

Consider this a playground, not anything useful.
